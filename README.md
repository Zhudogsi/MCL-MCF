# MCL-MCF
Hierarchical Alleviation of Heterogeneity in Multimodal Sentiment Analysis

### Introduction
Inspired by the fusion of objects in the natural world, we conceptualize multimodal fusion as a continuous process, dividing the entire procedure into
three steps. We design MCL-MCF. MCF simulates the continuous fusion process, while MCL, through multilevel alleviation of heterogeneity, assists MCF
in achieving multilevel fusion. Their collaborative operation yields optimal fusion results.

We are grateful for the open source baseline of MMIM. We built MCL-MCF on it. For configuration and dataset related open source, please refer to MMIM (https://github.com/declare-lab/Multimodal-Infomax?tab=readme-ov-file).
